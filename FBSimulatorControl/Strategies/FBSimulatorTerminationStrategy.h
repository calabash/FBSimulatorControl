 Kills all of the Simulators that are not launched by `FBSimulatorControl`.
 This can mean Simulators that werelaunched via Xcode or Instruments.
 Getting a Simulator host into a clean state improves the general reliability of Simulator management and launching.
 In addition, performance should increase as these Simulators won't take up any system resources.

 To make the runtime environment more predicatable, it is best to avoid using FBSimulatorControl in conjuction with tradition Simulator launching systems at the same time.
 This method will not kill Simulators that are launched by FBSimulatorControl in another, or the same process.
